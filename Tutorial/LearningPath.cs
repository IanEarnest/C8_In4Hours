        /* Learning C# full list
        
           0. C constructs
           0. basic Data Structures
           0. high level idea of OOP
        
           1. What is C#/ why Microsoft created C# in 2002 
               what is the .NET framework

           8. interfaces IEnumerable<T>, ICollection<T>, IList<T> and when to use appropriately
           foreach loop - only 
           IEnumerable<T> collections or

            // examples?
            #define 
            #if 
            #elif 


            //What?
            static string F(Func<string> func) => func();
